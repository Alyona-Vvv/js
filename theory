3 - What is memoization and what's the use it?
    ↑ memoization is a process of building a function that is capable of
    remembering it's previously computed results or values.
    The use of making a memoization function is that we avoid the computation of
    that function if it was already performed in the last calculations with the same arguments.
    This saves time but has a downside that we will consume more memory for saving the previous results.
